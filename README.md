This is an experimental application developed as part of a Quality Analytics effort by [Dan Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/william-dan-roberts-phd/12/738/11) and [Jonas Almeida](http://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/people) at [Stony Brook University](stonybrookmedicine.edu). It explores novel analytic workflows for private data stored in [secure box](https://stonybrookmedicine.app.box.com) enterprise accounts. The novel approach pursued here is that of moving code, which is exposed to public scrutiny for accuracy and reproducibility of the analytics it performs, onto secure environments hosting data that cannot and should not leave the protected container that holds it. This is a security driven instantiation of a “[beyond the data deluge](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5919/1297.full)” approach.
